# Type-2-Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning



## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of Type-2 diabetes using machine learning techniques. The dataset used includes various health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more, to build and evaluate several predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database and contains 768 rows and 9 columns, including:

- `Pregnancies`: Number of times pregnant
- `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration
- `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- `SkinThickness`: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- `Insulin`: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- `BMI`: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Diabetes pedigree function
- `Age`: Age (years)
- `Outcome`: Class variable (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic)
